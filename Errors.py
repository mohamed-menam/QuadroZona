# Logic errors
print("""
Logic errors>
A logic error is an error in the way a program works. 
The program can run but does not do what it is expected to do.
Logic errors can be caused by the programmer:
....1)incorrectly using logical operators, 
eg expecting a program to stop when the value of a variable reaches 5, but using <5 instead of <=5
....2)incorrectly using Boolean operators
....3)unintentionally creating a situation where an infinite loop may occur
....4)incorrectly using brackets in calculations
....5)unintentionally using the same variable name at different points 
in the program for different purposes
....6)using incorrect program design

# Runtime errors

print(("""
Runtime errors
A runtime error is an error that takes place during the running of a program.
An example is writing a program that tries to access the sixth item in an array 
that only contains five items. A runtime error is likely to crash the program.
